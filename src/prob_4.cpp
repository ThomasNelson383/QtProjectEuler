// Text from the problem https://projecteuler.net/problem=4
// Largest palindrome product:
// A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.
//
// Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

// Then if we found a Palindrom then we only need to go down to that B
//   First palindrom found was 995 x 583, so no we are
//   looping A from 995 to 583, and B from that same
//   because we no 994 * 582 will always yeild a smaller number
// We are also skipping any extra numbers if we found a number that is smaller than our max palindrome
